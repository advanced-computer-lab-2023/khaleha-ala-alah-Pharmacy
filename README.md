######## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend and backend of the project.

 **Frontend Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/advanced-computer-lab-2023/khaleha-ala-alah-Pharmacy
   ```

2. **Open the Folder**

   Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd khaleha-ala-alah-Pharmacy
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   Change to the frontend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd react-app
   npm i
   ```

4. **Start the Frontend**

   Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This should launch the frontend of your application in your default web browser.

 **Backend Installation**

1. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend directory from the root of the project:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm i
   ```

2. **Start the Backend Server**

   Start the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   The backend server should now be running and listening for requests.

######### How to Use

In this section, you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to use and configure the project using the provided environment variables.

 **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the project.
